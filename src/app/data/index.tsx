          “gods and Science” is a compelling exploration of the convergence
          between cutting-edge science, biblical prophecy, and the return of
          ancient forces that once shaped human history. As modern technology
          advances into realms once thought to belong to myth—we are faced with
          questions that echo the ancient narratives of Genesis 6:4. Could these
          advancements signal the return of the fallen ones and their influence
          over humanity?

          You know the story of Noah and the flood, but there&apos;s more to the
          tale. Before the Flood unveils the hidden truth—this was not just
          about saving the “righteous,” but about eradicating corruption that
          had tainted all of creation. This ebook reveals the story of Fallen
          Angels who imparted forbidden knowledge to humanity, leading to the
          birth of the Nephilim. Their bloodline didn&apos;t perish in the
          flood—it survived, shaping history long after the waters receded.
          Before the Flood brings together the Books of Enoch, Jasher, and
          Jubilees to offer a complete, clear explanation of why the flood
          happened and why it was necessary. It&apos;s a compelling retelling,
          blending details from each text into a cohesive story.

          The Book of Jasher uncovers Africa&apos;s important role in ancient
          scripture, bringing to light figures like Angeas, the King of Africa,
          and his son Anibal, who parallels the legendary Hannibal Barca of
          Carthage. This retelling of African kings—Bela, Azdrubal, and
          others—offers a fascinating connection between biblical events and
          Africa&apos;s historical significance. This captivating story shows how
          Africa influenced the ancient world and provides deeper insight into
          the struggle between Esau and Jacob that shaped the course of history.
